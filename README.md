# MUSICAI
Music AI is an interactive platform designed to help songwriters generate and refine lyrics for their music. Utilizing ChatGPT's advanced language model, the tool provides creative lyric suggestions based on a theme, emotion, or keyword provided by the user. The platform aims to streamline the songwriting process and enhance creative expression.

## Project Proposal 
**Due March 21, 11:59pm**

### Description of Problem/Opportunity
Songwriters often struggle with creating lyrics that resonate with their music or express their intended emotions. Lyricist AI offers a solution by providing a collaborative AI tool that can inspire and refine song lyrics.

### Proposed Solution/Approach
Develop an interface for ChatGPT that allows users to input specific themes, emotions, or keywords. The AI will generate lyric suggestions that align with these inputs. Users can iteratively refine the suggestions to fit their musical compositions.

### Project Outline and Timeline
- Submission of project proposal and initial design of the ChatGPT interface.
- Development and testing of the lyric generation features.
- User interface enhancements and beta testing with local songwriters.
- Final presentation at the AI Showcase.
## Goals of project 
**Due March 21, 11:59pm**

Describe 1-5 goals of the project. 
### Goal 1: To develop a generative model that can produce creative and contextually relevant lyrics.
### Goal 2: To ensure the interface is user-friendly and effectively supports the creative process of songwriters.

## Project Metrics 
**Due March 21, 11:59pm**

Compose 2-5 metrics to determine the success of the project. These should be measureable, and should translate to a letter grade for each. 
### Metric 1: Lyric Relevance and Creativity: At least 75% of the lyrics generated should be deemed creative and relevant by a test group of songwriters.
### Metric 2: User Engagement: Target a user engagement rate (repeat usage) of at least 70% among initial users.

## Self-Evaluation
**Due April 26, 11:59pm**

Goal 1: Development of the Generative Model
The generative model's ability to produce lyrics was satisfactory, with about 80% of the outputs aligning closely with the input themes and emotional cues provided by the users. This was slightly above our initial target, indicating that the training of the model on diverse datasets of song lyrics was effective. However, feedback from users suggested that while the lyrics were contextually relevant, they sometimes lacked the subtlety and depth that experienced songwriters sought. This highlighted an area for future improvement, particularly in enhancing the model's sensitivity to deeper emotional and thematic nuances.

Goal 2: User-Friendly Interface
The user interface was designed to be intuitive, allowing songwriters to easily input their requirements and receive suggestions. User feedback collected indicated a high level of satisfaction, with approximately 85% of users finding the interface to be user-friendly and helpful in their creative process. This achievement reflects the successful implementation of the interface design but also underscores the importance of ongoing updates based on user interactions and technological advancements.

The project has been profoundly educational, not only in applying AI in a creative context but also in managing a technology project from conception to execution. It challenged my problem-solving skills, especially when integrating feedback into the model refinement process. The experience has reinforced my interest in pursuing a career that bridges technology and creativity. The insights gained from working directly with end-users and iterating on their feedback will be invaluable in my future academic projects and professional work in tech development.

Looking forward, the project highlighted the importance of continuous learning, especially in AI, where the landscape evolves rapidly. It has motivated me to further explore AI's potential in other creative domains, possibly leading to a specialized career in AI applications for creative industries. This project was not just about building a functional AI tool but also about understanding the broader implications of AI in society, particularly in how it can enhance human creativity rather than replace it.


## Reflection on Learning
**Due April 26, 11:59pm**

Throughout the development of Lyricist AI, my understanding of artificial intelligence, especially its application in creative fields, has deepened significantly. This project was not only an exploration of technological implementation but also a journey into the potential of AI to complement and augment human creativity.

Initially, my perception of AI was largely centered around its capabilities in data analysis and automation. However, working on Lyricist AI exposed me to a different facet—AI as a collaborator in artistic processes. The challenge was to mold ChatGPT, fundamentally a language model, into a tool that can understand and generate creative content like song lyrics, which are deeply tied to human emotions and cultural nuances. This required not just technical skills in programming but also an understanding of linguistic styles, cultural relevance, and emotional expression.

One of the key takeaways from this project is the realization that AI can significantly enhance creative processes without replacing the human element. By providing a starting point or suggesting modifications, Lyricist AI acts as a digital muse that can inspire songwriters, offering a new perspective or helping them see past creative blocks. It’s fascinating to see how AI suggestions can be sparked by an initial input yet evolve uniquely with each interaction, shaped by the user's creative vision.

Moreover, this project has reshaped my understanding of AI's limitations and strengths. The iterative process of refining the model's outputs to make them more contextually appropriate and emotionally resonant highlighted the importance of human oversight in AI applications. It emphasized that while AI can generate content, the human role is crucial in curating and contextualizing this content to ensure it aligns with intended emotional and artistic goals.

This project has also impacted my view on ethical considerations in AI. Working closely with a tool that generates creative content led to questions about originality and the fine line between inspiration and plagiarism. It underscored the need for clear guidelines and ethical frameworks as AI becomes more integrated into creative fields.

Finally, this experience has influenced my future learning and career trajectory. I am more inclined now to pursue further education and career opportunities at the intersection of AI and creative technologies. Understanding and developing AI tools that assist in creative industries could be a promising field, given the growing demand for such technologies.


## What's Next?
**Due April 26, 11:59pm**

The success of the Lyricist AI project has motivated me to continue this venture beyond the academic environment. Seeing the potential impact of such a tool on songwriters and musicians has encouraged me to explore ways of enhancing and expanding its capabilities.

One immediate step is to improve the model’s understanding of different musical genres and cultural contexts to make it more versatile and useful for a diverse user base. Integrating feedback from initial users will be crucial in this phase, as it will help refine the AI to better serve the specific needs and challenges faced by songwriters.

Additionally, I plan to explore potential collaborations with a record label I am working with in Nashville called Drumatizd(DOA). This partnership could provide the necessary resources and industry insights to evolve Lyricist AI from a project into a commercial product.
